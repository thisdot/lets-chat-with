# Storybook

[//]: # 'TODO: Update the above docs and improve if necessary'

We're running Storybook to help track implementation vs designs. You can run Storybook using `npm run storybook`.

**Note:** Currently only the `shared` library that contains the common UI components has stories, hence Storybook support.
